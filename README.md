# Data Versioning with DVC (Data Version Control)

## Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to use **Git** and **DVC** (Data Version Control) to manage code, track data versions, and store large data files in remote storage (such as **AWS S3**). It provides an efficient way to version control datasets and manage large data files while keeping your code and data together.

## Workflow Overview:
1. **Code and Data Management**: Git tracks the code files and DVC tracks the data.
2. **Remote Storage**: AWS S3 (or any other supported remote storage) is used to store large datasets. //instead of this used a loclal file by name s3 to store data
3. **Versioning**: Both the code and the data are versioned, allowing you to track changes in data and rollback if necessary.
